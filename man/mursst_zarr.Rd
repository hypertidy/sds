\description{
This is used a lot of noisy fanfare about why everyone must move to Zarr in
the cloud. It's really big, daily netcdf blended/observation/model data on a
36000x18000 grid, a regular grid in -180, 180, -90, 90.
}
\details{
This zarr and every other one I've found is unuseably out of date.
It seems like this source doesn't go past "2020-01-21" or band 6443, don't know why that is.
